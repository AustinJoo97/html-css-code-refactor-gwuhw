# GWU Homework Assignment 1

Assignment given with a provided HTML and a corresponding CSS file in which students were asked to refactor the code and make adjustments for the sake of:
- Applying correct functionality to all links seen on screen
- Consolidate applied CSS to make code less redundant
- Apply comments to each file corresponding to all changed made to provided logic and process of difference

Finally, the assignment was asked to be deployed through the use of github pages.

Note: The initial github repo with this was set incorrectly and thus a new repository with the same assingment had to be created.
